                <p>Nymeria is a small, but powerful testing framework for JavaScript code. It comes with it's own easy
                    to read test runner and does not require a DOM. Nymeria uses syntax that's easy to read, write, and
                    comprehend.
                    <br /><br />
                    Please note that Nymeria is not for use in production environments, but can be a
                    great practice tool for learning similar, more powerful and widley used testing frameworks!

                <p>As you'll no doubt know by now, every element within a document is structured as a rectangular box
                    inside the document layout, with properties that can be altered like so:</p>
                <div class="image-wrapper">
                    <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13647/box-model-standard-small.png" alt="box model">

                <ul>
                    <li>width and height set the width/height of the content box.</li>
                    <li>The padding family of properties sets the width of the padding (don't forget longhand
                        properties
                        like padding-bottom that allow you to set one side at once).</li>
                    <li>The margin family of properties sets the width of the outer area surrounding the CSS box, which
                        pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout (again, longhand properties like margin-bottom
                        are
                        available).</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Advanced_Box_Properties">
            <header>Advanced Box Properties</header>
            <article>
                <p>Now we've had a brief recap, let's look at some more advanced box properties that you'll find
                    useful.</p>
                <h3>Setting width and height constraints</h3>
                <p>Other properties exist that allow more flexible ways of handling content box size ‚Äî setting size
                    constraints rather than an absolute size. This can be done with the properties <code>min-width</code>,
                    <code>max-width</code>, <code>min-height</code>,
                    and <code>max-height</code>.</p>
                <p>An obvious use is if you want to allow a layout's width to be flexible, by setting its outer
                    container's
                    width as a percentage, but you also don't want it to become too wide or too narrow because the
                    layout
                    would start to look bad. One option here
                    would be to use responsive web design techniques (which we'll cover later), but a simpler method
                    might
                    be to just give the layout a maximum and minimum width constraint:</p>
                <code>width: 70%;</code><br>
                <code>min-width: 480px;</code><br>
                <code>min-width: 480px;</code>
                <p>You could also couple this with the following line, which centers the container it is applied to
                    inside
                    its parent:</p>
                <code>margin: 0 auto;</code>
                <p>0 causes the top and bottom margins to be 0, while auto (in this case) shares the available space
                    between the left and right margins of the container, centering it. The end result is that when the
                    container is within the min and max width constraints,
                    it will fill the entire viewport width. When 1280px width is exceeded, the layout will stay at
                    1280px
                    wide, and start to be centered inside the available space. When the width goes below 480px, the
                    viewport will become smaller than the container,
                    and you'll have to scroll to see it all.</p>
                <h3>Changing the box model completely</h3>
                <p>The total width of a box is the sum of its <code>width</code>, <code>padding-right</code>, <code>padding-left</code>,
                    <code>border-right</code>, and <code>border-left</code> properties. In some cases it is annoying
                    (for
                    example, what if you want
                    to have a box with a total width of 50% with border and padding expressed in pixels?) To avoid such
                    problems, it's possible to tweak the box model with the property <code>box-sizing</code>. With the
                    value border-box, it changes the box model to
                    this new one:</p>
                <div class="image-wrapper">
                    <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13649/box-model-alt-small.png" alt="box model">
                </div>
                <p>Let's look at a live example. We will set up two identical elements, giving each one the same width,
                    border and padding. We will also use some JavaScript to print out the computed value (the final
                    on-screen value in pixels) of the width for each box. The only difference is that we've given the
                    bottom box box-sizing: border-box, but we've left the top box with its default behaviour.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Box_Display_Types">
            <header>Box Display Types</header>
            <article>
                <p>Everything we've said so far applies to boxes that represent block level elements. However, CSS has
                    other types of boxes that behave differently. The type of box applied to an element is specified by
                    the
                    display property.</p>
                <h3>Common Display Types</h3>
                <p>There are many different values available for display, the three most common ones of which are <code>block</code>,
                    <code>inline</code>, and <code>inline-block</code>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <code>block</code> box is defined as a box that's stacked upon other boxes (i.e. content
                        before
                        and after the box appears on a separate line), and can have width and height set on it. The
                        whole
                        box model as described above applies to block boxes.</li>
                    <li>An <code>inline</code> box is the opposite of a block box: it flows with the document's text
                        (i.e.
                        it will appear on the same line as surrounding text and other inline elements, and its content
                        will
                        break with the flow of the text, like lines
                        of text in a paragraph.) Width and height settings have no effect on <code>inline</code> boxes;
                        any
                        padding, margin and border set on <code>inline</code> boxes will update the position of
                        surrounding
                        text, but will not affect the position of
                        surrounding block boxes.</li>
                    <li>An <code>inline-block</code> box is something in between the first two: It flows with
                        surrounding
                        text without creating line breaks before and after it like an inline box, but it can be sized
                        using
                        width and height and maintains its block integrity
                        like a <code>block</code> box ‚Äî it won't be broken across paragraph lines (an inline-block box
                        that
                        overflows a line of text will drop down onto a 2nd line, as there is not enough space for it on
                        the
                        first line, and it won't break across two
                        lines.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By default, block level elements have display: block; set on them, and inline elements have display:
                    inline; set on them.</p>
                <h3>Uncommon display types</h3>
                <p>There are also some less commonly-used values for the <code>display</code> property that you will
                    come
                    across in your travels. Some of these have been around for a while and are fairly well supported,
                    while
                    others are newer and less well supported.
                    These values were generally created to make creating web page/application layouts easier. The most
                    interesting ones are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>display: table</code> ‚Äî allows you to emulate table layouts using non-table elements,
                        without
                        abusing table HTML to do so.</li>
                    <li><code>display: flex</code> ‚Äî allows you to solve many classic layout problems that have plagued
                        CSS
                        for a long time, such as laying out a series of containers in flexible equal width columns, or
                        vertically centering content.</li>
                    <li><code>display: grid</code> ‚Äî gives CSS a native way of easily implementing grid systems,
                        whereas it
                        has traditionally relied on somewhat hack-ish CSS grid frameworks. </li>

                <p>CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they
                    are
                    positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around
                    them,
                    their parent container, or the main viewport/window. The page layout techniques we'll be covering
                    in
                    more detail in this module are</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Normal flow</li>
                    <li>The <code>display</code> Property</li>
                    <li>Flexbox</li>
                    <li>Grid</li>
                    <li>Floats</li>

                    <li>Multiple-column layout</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages, and no technique is designed to be used
                    in
                    isolation. By understanding what each method is designed for you will be in a good place to
                    understand
                    which is the best layout tool for each task.</p>
